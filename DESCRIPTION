    person(given = "Christian Alexander",

Description: Creates a 'visual citation' containing the metadata of a scientific paper.
    A 'visual citation' is a banner containing e.g. title, authors, journal, year of a paper. 
    The resulting banner can be included in a presentation to back up your claims, 
    especially when you want to drop an important name, publication, journal.
    Seen in the wild, such banners are often pixelated screenshots and displayed way too short for the 
    audience to actually record them. 
    namedropR can create these banners in high quality and even provide a QR code for the audience to scan.

Description: Provides 'visual citations' containing the metadata of a scientific paper.
    A 'visual citation' is a banner containing e.g. title, authors, journal, year of a publication.
    This package can create such banners in high quality based on a *.bib file and 
    includes a QR code pointing to the DOI for the audience to scan. 
    The resulting banner can be included in a presentation to back up your claims, 
    especially when you want to drop an important name, research group, journal,
    but also to genuinely point the audience to good resources for further reading.
    Seen in the wild, such banners are often either a low resolution screenshot or 
    displayed way too short for the audience to actually grasp them.
    This package is not intended as replacement for proper reference manager packages, 
    but a tool to enrich scientific presentation slides.
